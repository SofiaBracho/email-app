This is a simple email client simulation built using Django. It allows registered users to send and receive emails, manage their inbox, archive and reply received emails. Everything in a single page, managing views and request using asyncronous JavaScript. In the back-end it works with Django.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
- **Email dashboard**: To view the inbox, visit the `/` page. Here, users can see all emails that have been sent to them. To view a specific email, click on its subject, it will be marked as readed.

- **Sent dashboard**: Click the `sent` button to see all the emails sent by you.

- **Compose email**: To compose a new email, visit the `/compose` page and enter the recipient email addresses, subject, and body of the email. The email will be sent to the recipient and stored in the sender's sent folder.

- **Archive email**: To archive an email, visit the email detail page and click the "Archive" button. The email will be moved to the archive folder. To view the archive folder, visit the `/archive` page.
  
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out of the application.
